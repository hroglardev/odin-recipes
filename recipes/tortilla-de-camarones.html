    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The shrimp, also known as "quisquilla," is a crustacean with a delicate shell and a long tail, typically gray or transparent in color. It is similar to prawns but much smaller and is very
      abundant in the CÃ¡diz area, being one of the most typical dishes of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most typical recipes in this province is "tortillitas," which are made using a base of dough consisting of wheat flour, chickpea flour, onion, parsley, water, salt, and, of course,
      usually live shrimp. Small tortillas are formed with this dough in a pan, frying them in ample olive oil, and they are eaten freshly fried, resulting in a delicious and crispy treat.

      <li>Add the prepared shrimp to the batter and mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
      <li>In a frying pan, heat a generous amount of olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Spoon portions of the batter with shrimp into the hot oil, forming small tortillas. Fry until golden brown on both sides.</li>
      <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove the tortillitas from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with a bit of salt while they are still hot.</li>
      <li>Serve the tortillitas de camarones hot and freshly fried.</li>
