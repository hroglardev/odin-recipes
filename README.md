# Odin-recipes

First project of the odin project to practise basic HTML

# What the project is about

This project is a basic HTML project in which I will practise what I've learned so far in using all the concepts for a page about food recipes.

# What have I learned so far?

In this project I implemented the use of basic tags such as

<ul>
  <li>Headings</li>
  <li>Paragraphs</li>
  <li>Lists</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Links</li>
</ul>

I also provided some folder structure and practised commands from the terminal in order to practise.
In addition my project does not have CSS implemented into it so far but will in the future as I progress through the curriculum.

# Update CSS

I have added some basic styling as I progress through the curriculum of CSS in order to practise basic units and some responsiveness.
